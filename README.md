## User Manual
### How to play?
When playing you will start off with a deck of cards, 3 cards in your hand and 1 'mana'. To place a card down simply drag a card from your hand onto the board (by releasing) with your cursor, also note to place a card down you must have the required 'mana' you can view your mana from the bottom right of the screen. You can also view the mana cost of the card (being the value at the top left of the card). The cards you can place a card down will be outlined by a green border around the card. Then to end your turn simply click the end turn button. The opponent will then place a card down. It will then be your turn again and also note you will draw a card every turn as well as gain 1 mana crystal. 

You can now use your card to attack the enemy's card as cards have to wait 1 turn after being placed to attack. The bottom left value on the cards are the attack value and the bottom right value on the cards are the health value. To attack the enemy simply click on the card you want to attack with and click on the opponent's card you want to attack, you can attack once per turn with each card. Note that when attacking the enemy's card will also deal damage to your card (The enemy's card's health is subtracted by your attack and your card's health is subtracted by the enemy's card's attack). 

To win you must attack the enemy 'hero' and when their health reaches 0 you win, however when your health reaches 0 the enemy wins and you lose. The player also has a 'hero power' which deals 1 damage to the opponent of the players choice and can choose by simply clicking on the hero power next to the hero portrait and clicking on an enemy of their choice, however note this costs 2 mana to play. 

Finally also note some of the player's cards will have card effects which also have a big impact on the gameplay. The following keywords show their effect:
Battlecry = When the card is played the effect is played.
Taunt = That card must be attacked and other cards cannot be attacked.
Divine Shield = The card is invulnerable to any damage taken next, then breaks.


TLDR: Each card can attack once per turn. Both players draw a card every turn. The player has mana which is used to play cards down (which cost mana). To win you must attack the enemy hero until their health reaches 0. However when your hero's portrait reaches 0, you lose. Cards also have card effects which change gameplay strategies and decisions etc.
